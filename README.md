Maths Tutor app remade using Electron
This is a basic rebuild of an app that I made a few years ago originally in Unity. I built it to try and get more familiar with/comfortable with Electron and JS.
Since the app was basically made just for the sake of practice, I haven't released a packaged version of the file, however if you would like to run the app and 
see what it is like here is how:

1. Download the repository to your PC

2. Navigate to the repository using your command line or terminal

3. Install Electron dependencies to the directory; 
  - with npm this can be done with `npm install --save-dev electron`
  - with yarn this can be done with `yarn add --dev electron`

4. Run the app from the command line;
  - with npm this can be done with `npm start`
  - with yarn this can be done with `yarn start`
